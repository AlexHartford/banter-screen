Your job is to create an iOS app and implement this interface using Swift.

**DO NOT** implement as-is. Part of your job is to standardize this design to bring it in line with modern mobile development paradigms.

Note:
1. This is the landing page for the application
2. Core functionality is as follows:
    1. User has an overview of existing conversations
    2. User can view notifications page
    3. User can view a conversation with another user
    4. User can start a conversation with a new user
  
You do not have to implement the interfaces for ii - iv, a blank page with a title corresponding to the page is fine.

The data structure for a contact is as follows:
```json
{
    "userUid": "c1ad15c1-469b-4942-a194-d35158aa55ac",
    "userName": "Alex Hartford",
    "createdAt": 1633463730
}
```
